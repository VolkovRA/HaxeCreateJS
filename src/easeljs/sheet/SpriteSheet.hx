/**
 * Encapsulates the properties and methods associated with a sprite sheet.
 * A sprite sheet is a series of images (usually animation frames) combined into a larger image (or images).
 * For example, an animation consisting of eight 100x100 images could be combined into a single 400x200
 * sprite sheet (4 frames across by 2 high).
 * 
 * <b>Generating SpriteSheet Images</b>
 * Spritesheets can be created manually by combining images in PhotoShop, and specifying the frame size or
 * coordinates manually, however there are a number of tools that facilitate this.
 *   1. Exporting SpriteSheets or HTML5 content from Adobe Flash/Animate supports the EaselJS SpriteSheet format.
 *   2. The popular Texture Packer has EaselJS support.
 *   3. SWF animations in Adobe Flash/Animate can be exported to SpriteSheets using ZoÃ«
 * 
 * <b>Cross Origin Issues</b>
 * <b>Warning:</b> Images loaded cross-origin will throw cross-origin security errors when interacted with using:
 *   1. A mouse.
 *   2. Methods such as getObjectUnderPoint.
 *   3. Filters (see Filter).
 *   4. Caching (see cache).
 * 
 * You can get around this by setting crossOrigin property on your images before passing them to EaselJS, or setting
 * the crossOrigin property on PreloadJS' LoadQueue or LoadItems.
 * <code>
 * var img = new Image();
 * img.crossOrigin="Anonymous";
 * img.src = "http://server-with-CORS-support.com/path/to/image.jpg";
 * </code>
 * 
 * If you pass string paths to SpriteSheets, they will not work cross-origin. The server that stores the image must
 * support cross-origin requests, or this will not work. For more information, check out CORS overview on MDN.
 * 
 * EVENTS
 * Event.COMPLETE	Dispatched when all images are loaded. Note that this only fires if the images were not fully
 * 					loaded when the sprite sheet was initialized. You should check the complete property to prior
 * 					to adding a listener.
 * 
 * Event.ERROR		Dispatched when an image encounters an error. A SpriteSheet will dispatch an error event for
 * 					each image that encounters an error, and will still dispatch a complete event once all images
 * 					are finished processing, even if an error is encountered.
 * 
 * Event.GET_FRAME	Dispatched when getFrame is called with a valid frame index. This is primarily intended for use
 * 					by SpriteSheetBuilder when doing on-demand rendering.
